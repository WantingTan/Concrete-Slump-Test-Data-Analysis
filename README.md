# Concrete-Slump-Test-Data-Analysis
Feature engineering and modeling

Concrete is a highly complex material which makes modeling behavior a very difficult task. The workability of concrete can be measured by Concrete Slump Test. This particular dataset report some results about measurement of Compressive Strength of concrete. We could optimize the use of materials to form the concrete in order to decrease the costs of construction and also meet the requirement of concrete. For given dataset there are 7 input variables and 3 output variables.

## Objective
-Descriptive Statistics of Data Set <br/>
-Build tree model for Compressive Strength <br/>
-Furthere Analysis
